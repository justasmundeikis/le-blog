<h4>BRO: Economic Insights</h4>
<p>The Phillips curve links price or wage growth to a measure of economic slack, such as the output gap and provides a framework for analyzing
and forecasting inflation developments.</p>

<p>Phillips curves for Euro area (19), Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are estimated using the simple linear regression.</p>

<p>The simple framework model explains about 18-20 percent of variation in inflation. The coefficients associated with the gaps, or the “slopes” of the Phillips curve, are significant and their signs are as expected - wider negative gaps are  typically accompanied by lower inflation rates. According to the $R^2$ coefficient, the output and unemployment gap can explain around 18-20\% variation in inflation in this simple framework. The intercepts depict the expected average core inflation rate given a 0-gap from potential GDP. In this scenario, annual core inflation rate in Estonia is estimated at 2.6\%, in Latvia 3.3\% and in Lithuania 2.3\%</p>
