<p>Transparency International released its yearly Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI). Estonia scored highest with CPI of 70 and ranked 22nd , Lithuania scored 59 points and ranked
38th , while Latvia achieved only 57 points and ranked 44th . Poland reached 62 points and ranked 29th. I used a simple linear regression to estimates the results of one CPI point gain on GDP/capita in PPP. The estimated model suggests, that 1 point increase in CPI increases the GDP/capita in PPP by 4.6 %.</p>
